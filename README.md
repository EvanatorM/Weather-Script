# Run
To run, I would recommend creating a venv to install the requirements in. In a terminal set to the project directory, run:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/scripts/activate
```

Then, install the requirements from requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the script using this command:
```bash
python weather.py
```
